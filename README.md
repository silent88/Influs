INFLUS Project
==============
**WARNING: ALPHA LEVEL CODE**

If you have no idea what this code does, good neither do I :D  
The reason for this repository is to better coordinate the activities of a core Team of reasearchers.

OBJECTIVES
----------
1. Do advanced statistical research on the basis of _Instagram Influencer_ behavior.
2. Structure the project as a didactic lab to teach "big data" analysis to non-profesionals.
3. Create a reporting product based on the [Jupyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook) framework.
